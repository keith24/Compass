# Compass web app
###### by [Keith Irwin](https://keithirwin.us/)

Uses [DeviceOrientationEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceOrientationEvent) to show a phone's polar orientation.  

## Known issues

* When the screen is rotated, the image gets rotated 90 degrees.  I don' know how this could be fixed. 

#### Image sources

The images used in this app were labeled for reuse with modification:

* The main compass image is from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Compass_rose_nesw.svg)
* The icons are adapted from an image found on [goodfreephotos.com](https://www.goodfreephotos.com/vector-images/compass-rose-vector-clipart.png.php)
