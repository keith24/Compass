# Compass web app
###### by [Keith Irwin](https://keithirwin.us/)

Uses [DeviceOrientationEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceOrientationEvent) to show a phone's polar orientation.  

## Instructions

Open [compass.keithirwin.us](https://compass.keithirwin.us/) on a smartphone with a compass.  Hold the phone level and it should show your direction.  

### Is this accurate? 

No, not really.  Results may vary.  As of this writing, Firefox and Chrome browsers handle the DeviceOrientation spec differently.  It's only been tested on Chrome for Android.  

## Known issues

* When the screen is rotated, the image gets rotated 90 degrees.  I don' know how this could be fixed. 

## Image sources
